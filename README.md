# Monte Carlo Cost Estimation Models

This project simulates project cost uncertainty using three types of Monte Carlo simulations:
- Triangular Distribution
- Lognormal Distribution
- Beta-PERT Distribution

## 📊 Features

- Sensitivity Analysis (Tornado Chart)
- Correlation Analysis
- Distributional Comparison
- Input: 3-point estimates (Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessimistic)

## 📁 Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for each model
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for full automation
- `data/`: WBS input files
- `charts/`: Output visualizations

## 🔧 Run the Project

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
